# Running the examples

From the command line:

```
% pip install bdsim
```

Then you can run the examples from the command line, for example

```
% ./eg1.py
```

which will display a graph in a new figure window.  Close the figure to allow the program to exit.

Other examples include:

- `eg1.py` the example given above
- `waveform.py` two signal generators connected to two scopes

Examples from Chapter four of [_Robotics, Vision & Control (2017)_](https://petercorke.com/rvc/home):

- `rvc4_2.py` Fig 4.2 - a car-like vehicle with bicycle kinematics driven by a rectangular pulse steering signal
- `rvc4_4.py` Fig 4.4 - a car-like vehicle driving to a point

- `rvc4_6.py` Fig 4.6 - a car-like vehicle driving to/along a line


- `rvc4_11.py` Fig 4.11 a car-like vehicle driving to a pose


Figs 4.8 (pure pursuit) and Fig 4.21 (quadrotor control) are yet to be done.
